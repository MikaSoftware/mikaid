MikaID
====

**Project still being developed. Not ready for production.**

A web framework for building user identity and access management (IAM) for all applications.

The goal of ``MikaID`` is to provide a portal for all your micro-services and web applications to have:

* Authorization - How do I confirm who this person is?
* Identity - Everything about the person. Think name, email, address, tenant_id
* Permissions/roles - What can this person do?

Most notably, it makes use of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [Django oAuth 2.0 Toolbox](https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit).
